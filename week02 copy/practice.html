                Dr.Bush talked about information is not absorbed efficiently at the time by stating that the time scientists spent reading scholarly work is much less than the time they spent writing them. 
                Therefore, for better efficiency, Dr. Bush depicted how the technologies can evolve to help people take in more useful information at a faster speed. <br>
                I found it to be interesting to see how Dr. Bush predicted the future technologies evolved with the knowledge that he had from his time period. 
                Although some predictions are overly utopian to the extent of being unrealistic, some are indeed on the right track in nowadays evolution. I did realize that as the technologies get more advanced, it is easier for people to search for the information that they want. 
                Meanwhile, since information is more accessible, people do not have to memorize all information all the time anymore, which is kind of contradictory to Dr. Bushâ€™s original goal which is to absorb information more efficiently.
