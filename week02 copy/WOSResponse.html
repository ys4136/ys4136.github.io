                I think it is interesting to see how Berger viewed the relationship between women and artworks.  
                Berger first talked about the difference between nudity and nakedness in the videos. 
                He stated that being naked is to be oneself without disguise; whereas, being nude is to turn the surface of one’s body into a disguise that cannot be discarded. 
                However, most uncovered women in artworks were nudes, which means that women in the paintings usually appeared in the form of how men and spectators wanted to view them instead of being who they really are. 
                Berger also mentioned another point about the values of oil painting at the time. With the invention of oil painting, artists were able to portray people and things more realistic in an unprecedented way,  
                the form of oil painting had become the ideal way of preserving and celebrating people’s private possessions. 
                Therefore, oil paintings that portray nude women were also counted as private possessions of their spectators, and this is implying the idea that women were considered as objects that can be traded among men back in the time.
